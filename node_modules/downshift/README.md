## The problem

You need an autocomplete/dropdown/select experience in your application and you
want it to be accessible. You also want it to be simple and flexible to account
for your use cases.

## This solution

This is a component that controls user interactions and state for you so you can
create autocomplete/dropdown/select/etc. components. It uses a [render
prop][use-a-render-prop] which gives you maximum flexibility with a minimal API
because you are responsible for the rendering of everything and you simply apply
props to what you're rendering.

This differs from other solutions which render things for their use case and
then expose many options to allow for extensibility resulting in a bigger API
that is less flexible as well as making the implementation more complicated and
harder to contribute to.

> NOTE: The original use case of this component is autocomplete, however the API
> is powerful and flexible enough to build things like dropdowns as well.

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and
should be installed as one of your project's `dependencies`:

```
npm install --save downshift
```

> This package also depends on `react` and `prop-types`. Please make sure you
> have those installed as well.

> Note also this library supports `preact` out of the box. If you are using
> `preact` then use the corresponding module in the `preact/dist` folder. You
> can even `import Downshift from 'downshift/preact'` üëç

## Usage

> [Try it out in the browser](https://codesandbox.io/s/6z67jvklw3)

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import {render} from 'react-dom'
import Downshift from 'downshift'

const items = [
  {value: 'apple'},
  {value: 'pear'},
  {value: 'orange'},
  {value: 'grape'},
  {value: 'banana'},
]

render(
  <Downshift
    onChange={selection => alert(`You selected ${selection.value}`)}
    itemToString={item => (item ? item.value : '')}
  >
    {({
      getInputProps,
      getItemProps,
      getLabelProps,
      isOpen,
      inputValue,
      highlightedIndex,
      selectedItem,
    }) => (
      <div>
        <label {...getLabelProps()}>Enter a fruit</label>
        <input {...getInputProps()} />
        {isOpen ? (
          <div>
            {items
              .filter(item => !inputValue || item.value.includes(inputValue))
              .map((item, index) => (
                <div
                  {...getItemProps({
                    key: item.value,
                    index,
                    item,
                    style: {
                      backgroundColor:
                        highlightedIndex === index ? 'lightgray' : 'white',
                      fontWeight: selectedItem === item ? 'bold' : 'normal',
                    },
                  })}
                >
                  {item.value}
                </div>
              ))}
          </div>
        ) : null}
      </div>
    )}
  </Downshift>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
)
```

`<Downshift />` is the only component. It doesn't render anything itself, it just
calls the render function and renders that. ["Use a render
prop!"][use-a-render-prop]! `<Downshift>{downshift => <div>/* your JSX here! */</div>}</Downshift>`.

## Props

### defaultSelectedItem

> `any` | defaults to `null`

Pass an item or an array of items that should be selected by default.

### defaultHighlightedIndex

> `number`/`null` | defaults to `null`

This is the initial index to highlight when the menu first opens.

### defaultInputValue

> `string` | defaults to `''`

This is the initial input value.

### defaultIsOpen

> `boolean` | defaults to `false`

This is the initial `isOpen` value.

### itemToString

> `function(item: any)` | defaults to: `i => (i == null ? '' : String(i))`

Used to determine the string value for the selected item (which is used to
compute the `inputValue`).

### selectedItemChanged

> `function(prevItem: any, item: any)` | defaults to: `(prevItem, item) => (prevItem !== item)`

Used to determine if the new `selectedItem` has changed compared to the previous
`selectedItem` and properly update Downshift's internal state.

### getA11yStatusMessage

> `function({/* see below */})` | default messages provided in English

This function is passed as props to a `Status` component nested within and
allows you to create your own assertive ARIA statuses.

A default `getA11yStatusMessage` function is provided that will check
`resultCount` and return "No results." or if there are results but no item is
highlighted, "`resultCount` results are available, use up and down arrow keys to
navigate." If an item is highlighted it will run `itemToString(highlightedItem)`
and display the value of the `highlightedItem`.

The object you are passed to generate your status message has the following
properties:

| property              | type            | description                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `highlightedIndex`    | `number`/`null` | The currently highlighted index                                                              |
| `highlightedItem`     | `any`           | The value of the highlighted item                                                            |
| `inputValue`          | `string`        | The current input value                                                                      |
| `isOpen`              | `boolean`       | The `isOpen` state                                                                           |
| `itemToString`        | `function(any)` | The `itemToString` function (see props) for getting the string value from one of the options |
| `previousResultCount` | `number`        | The total items showing in the dropdown the last time the status was updated                 |
| `resultCount`         | `number`        | The total items showing in the dropdown                                                      |
| `selectedItem`        | `any`           | The value of the currently selected item                                                     |

### onChange

> `function(selectedItem: any, stateAndHelpers: object)` | optional, no useful
> default

Called when the user selects an item and the selected item has changed. Called
with the item that was selected and the new state of `downshift`. (see
`onStateChange` for more info on `stateAndHelpers`).

- `selectedItem`: The item that was just selected
- `stateAndHelpers`: This is the same thing your `render` prop function is
  called with (see [Render Prop Function](#render-prop-function))

### onSelect

> `function(selectedItem: any, stateAndHelpers: object)` | optional, no useful
> default

Called when the user selects an item, regardless of the previous selected item.
Called with the item that was selected and the new state of `downshift`. (see
`onStateChange` for more info on `stateAndHelpers`).

- `selectedItem`: The item that was just selected
- `stateAndHelpers`: This is the same thing your `render` prop function is
  called with (see [Render Prop Function](#render-prop-function))

### onStateChange

> `function(changes: object, stateAndHelpers: object)` | optional, no useful
> default

This function is called anytime the internal state changes. This can be useful
if you're using downshift as a "controlled" component, where you manage some or
all of the state (e.g. isOpen, selectedItem, highlightedIndex, etc) and then
pass it as props, rather than letting downshift control all its state itself.
The parameters both take the shape of internal state (`{highlightedIndex: number, inputValue: string, isOpen: boolean, selectedItem: any}`) but differ
slightly.

- `changes`: These are the properties that actually have changed since the last
  state change. This also has a `type` property which you can learn more about
  in the [`stateChangeTypes`](#statechangetypes) section.
- `stateAndHelpers`: This is the exact same thing your `render` prop function is
  called with (see [Render Prop Function](#render-prop-function))

> Tip: This function will be called any time _any_ state is changed. The best
> way to determine whether any particular state was changed, you can use
> `changes.hasOwnProperty('propName')`.

### stateReducer

> `function(state: object, changes: object)` | optional

**üö® This is a really handy power feature üö®**

This function will be called each time `downshift` sets its internal state
(or calls your `onStateChange` handler for control props). It allows you to
modify the state change that will take place which can give you fine grain
control over how the component interacts with user updates without having to
use [Control Props](#control-props). It gives you the current state and the
state that will be set, and you return the state that you want to set.

- `state`: The full current state of downshift.
- `changes`: These are the properties that are about to change. This also has a
  `type` property which you can learn more about in the
  [`stateChangeTypes`](#statechangetypes) section.

```jsx
const ui = (
  <Downshift stateReducer={stateReducer}>{/* your callback */}</Downshift>
)

function stateReducer(state, changes) {
  // this prevents the menu from being closed when the user
  // selects an item with a keyboard or mouse
  switch (changes.type) {
    case Downshift.stateChangeTypes.keyDownEnter:
    case Downshift.stateChangeTypes.clickItem:
      return {
        ...changes,
        isOpen: state.isOpen,
        highlightedIndex: state.highlightedIndex,
      }
    default:
      return changes
  }
}
```

### onInputValueChange

> `function(inputValue: string, stateAndHelpers: object)` | optional, no useful
> default

Called whenever the input value changes. Useful to use instead or in combination
of `onStateChange` when `inputValue` is a controlled prop to
[avoid issues with cursor positions](https://github.com/paypal/downshift/issues/217).

- `inputValue`: The current value of the input
- `stateAndHelpers`: This is the same thing your `render` prop function is
  called with (see [Render Prop Function](#render-prop-function))

### itemCount

> `number` | optional, defaults the number of times you call getItemProps

This is useful if you're using some kind of virtual listing component for
"windowing" (like
[`react-virtualized`](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized)).

### highlightedIndex

> `number` | **control prop** (read more about this in the "Control Props"
> section below)

The index that should be highlighted

### inputValue

> `string` | **control prop** (read more about this in the "Control Props"
> section below)

The value the input should have

### isOpen

> `boolean` | **control prop** (read more about this in the "Control Props"
> section below)

Whether the menu should be considered open or closed. Some aspects of the
downshift component respond differently based on this value (for example, if
`isOpen` is true when the user hits "Enter" on the input field, then the item at
the `highlightedIndex` item is selected).

### selectedItem

> `any`/`Array(any)` | **control prop** (read more about this in the "Control
> Props" section below)

The currently selected item.

### render

> `function({})` | _required_

This is called with an object. Read more about the properties of this object in
the section "[Render Prop Function](#render-prop-function)".

### id

> `string` | defaults to a generated ID

You should not normally need to set this prop. It's only useful if you're server
rendering items (which each have an `id` prop generated based on the `downshift`
`id`). For more information see the `FAQ` below.

### environment

> `window` | defaults to `window`

You should not normally need to set this prop. It's only useful if you're
rendering into a different `window` context from where your JavaScript is
running, for example an iframe.

### onOuterClick

> `function(stateAndHelpers: object)` | optional

A helper callback to help control internal state of downshift like `isOpen` as
mentioned in [this issue](https://github.com/paypal/downshift/issues/206). The
same behavior can be achieved using `onStateChange`, but this prop is provided
as a helper because it's a fairly common use-case if you're controlling the
`isOpen` state:

```jsx
const ui = (
  <Downshift
    isOpen={this.state.menuIsOpen}
    onOuterClick={() => this.setState({menuIsOpen: false})}
  >
    {/* your callback */}
  </Downshift>
)
```

This callback will only be called if `isOpen` is `true`.

## stateChangeTypes

There are a few props that expose changes to state
([`onStateChange`](#onstatechange) and [`stateReducer`](#statereducer)).
For you to make the most of these APIs, it's important for you to understand
why state is being changed. To accomplish this, there's a `type` property on the
`changes` object you get. This `type` corresponds to a
`Downshift.stateChangeTypes` property. If you want to see what change types
are available, run this in your app:

```javascript
console.log(Object.keys(Downshift.stateChangeTypes))
```

## Control Props

downshift manages its own state internally and calls your `onChange` and
`onStateChange` handlers with any relevant changes. The state that downshift
manages includes: `isOpen`, `selectedItem`, `inputValue`, and
`highlightedIndex`. Your render prop function (read more below) can be used to
manipulate this state from within the render function and can likely support
many of your use cases.

However, if more control is needed, you can pass any of these pieces of state as
a prop (as indicated above) and that state becomes controlled. As soon as
`this.props[statePropKey] !== undefined`, internally, `downshift` will determine
its state based on your prop's value rather than its own internal state. You
will be required to keep the state up to date (this is where `onStateChange`
comes in really handy), but you can also control the state from anywhere, be
that state from other components, `redux`, `react-router`, or anywhere else.

> Note: This is very similar to how normal controlled components work elsewhere
> in react (like `<input />`). If you want to learn more about this concept, you
> can learn about that from this the ["Controlled Components"
> lecture][controlled-components-lecture] and exercises from [React
> Training's][react-training] [Advanced React][advanced-react] course.

## Render Prop Function

This is where you render whatever you want to based on the state of `downshift`.
It's a regular prop called `render`: `<Downshift render={/* right here*/} />`.

> You can also pass it as the children prop if you prefer to do things that way
> `<Downshift>{/* right here*/}</Downshift>`

The properties of this object can be split into three categories as indicated
below:

### prop getters

> See
> [the blog post about prop getters](https://blog.kentcdodds.com/how-to-give-rendering-control-to-users-with-prop-getters-549eaef76acf)

These functions are used to apply props to the elements that you render. This
gives you maximum flexibility to render what, when, and wherever you like. You
call these on the element in question (for example: `<input {...getInputProps()}`)). It's advisable to pass all your props to that function
rather than applying them on the element yourself to avoid your props being
overridden (or overriding the props returned). For example:
`getInputProps({onKeyUp(event) {console.log(event)}})`.

| property               | type              | description                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getToggleButtonProps` | `function({})`    | returns the props you should apply to any menu toggle button element you render.            |
| `getInputProps`        | `function({})`    | returns the props you should apply to the `input` element that you render.                  |
| `getItemProps`         | `function({})`    | returns the props you should apply to any menu item elements you render.                    |
| `getLabelProps`        | `function({})`    | returns the props you should apply to the `label` element that you render.                  |
| `getRootProps`         | `function({},{})` | returns the props you should apply to the root element that you render. It can be optional. |

#### `getRootProps`

Most of the time, you can just render a `div` yourself and `Downshift` will
apply the props it needs to do its job (and you don't need to call this
function). However, if you're rendering a composite component (custom component)
as the root element, then you'll need to call `getRootProps` and apply that to
your root element.

Required properties:

- `refKey`: if you're rendering a composite component, that component will need
  to accept a prop which it forwards to the root DOM element. Commonly, folks
  call this `innerRef`. So you'd call: `getRootProps({refKey: 'innerRef'})` and
  your composite component would forward like: `<div ref={props.innerRef} />`

If you're rendering a composite component, `Downshift` checks that
`getRootProps` is called and that `refKey` is a prop of the returned composite
component. This is done to catch common causes of errors but, in some cases, the
check could fail even if the ref is correctly forwarded to the root DOM
component. In these cases, you can provide the object `{suppressRefError : true}` as the second argument to `getRootProps` to completely bypass the check.\
**Please use it with extreme care and only if you are absolutely sure that the ref
is correctly forwarded otherwise `Downshift` will unexpectedly fail.**\
See [#235](https://github.com/paypal/downshift/issues/235) for the discussion that lead to this.

#### `getInputProps`

This method should be applied to the `input` you render. It is recommended that
you pass all props as an object to this method which will compose together any
of the event handlers you need to apply to the `input` while preserving the ones
that `downshift` needs to apply to make the `input` behave.

There are no required properties for this method.

Optional properties:

- `disabled`: If this is set to true, then no event handlers will be returned from `getInputProps` and a `disabled` prop will be returned (effectively disabling the input).

#### `getLabelProps`

This method should be applied to the `label` you render. It is useful for
ensuring that the `for` attribute on the `<label>` (`htmlFor` as a react prop)
is the same as the `id` that appears on the `input`. If no `htmlFor` is provided
then an ID will be generated and used for the `input` and the `label` `for`
attribute.

There are no required properties for this method.

> Note: You can definitely get by without using this (just provide an `id` to
> your input and the same `htmlFor` to your `label` and you'll be good with
> accessibility). However, we include this so you don't forget and it makes
> things a little nicer for you. You're welcome üòÄ

#### `getItemProps`

The props returned from calling this function should be applied to any menu
items you render.

**This is an impure function**, so it should only be called when you will
actually be applying the props to an item.

<details>

<summary>What do you mean by impure function?</summary>

Basically just don't do this:

```jsx
items.map(item => {
  const props = getItemProps({item}) // we're calling it here
  if (!shouldRenderItem(item)) {
    return null // but we're not using props, and downshift thinks we are...
  }
  return <div {...props} />
})
```

Instead, you could do this:

```jsx
items.filter(shouldRenderItem).map(item => <div {...getItemProps({item})} />)
```

</details>

Required properties:

- `item`: this is the item data that will be selected when the user selects a
  particular item.

Optional properties:

- `index`: This is how `downshift` keeps track of your item when updating the
  `highlightedIndex` as the user keys around. By default, `downshift` will
  assume the `index` is the order in which you're calling `getItemProps`. This
  is often good enough, but if you find odd behavior, try setting this
  explicitly. It's probably best to be explicit about `index` when using a
  windowing library like `react-virtualized`.
- `disabled`: If this is set to `true`, then all of the downshift item event
  handlers will be omitted. Items will not be highlighted when hovered,
  and items will not be selected when clicked.

#### `getToggleButtonProps`

Call this and apply the returned props to a `button`. It allows you to toggle
the `Menu` component. You can definitely build something like this yourself (all
of the available APIs are exposed to you), but this is nice because it will also
apply all of the proper ARIA attributes.

Optional properties:

- `disabled`: If this is set to `true`, then all of the downshift button event
  handlers will be omitted (it wont toggle the menu when clicked).
- `aria-label`: The `aria-label` prop is in English. You should probably override
  this yourself so you can provide translations:

```jsx
